## Problem Statement TBG5: Launch-Ready Website for the College

### Context
A well-designed college website serves as the face of the institution, providing crucial information for prospective students, parents, faculty, and stakeholders. It should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and informative while ensuring that all key sections are readily accessible.

### Challenge
Using Tiram.AI, your task is to build a fully functional and launch-ready website for a college. Your website should:

- Facilitate student inquiries.

### Requirements
Your website must include the following key sections:
- **Homepage:**  
  An engaging landing page that represents the college’s vision, achievements, and key highlights.
- **About Us:**  
  Details about the institution, its history, faculty, and core values.
- **Admissions & Courses:**  
  Information about available programs, admission criteria, and the application process.

  Showcasing student achievements and alumni success.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:**

1. **Initial Setup:**  
   Defining the structure, in this case using Marketing Sites and key requirements of the website.
2. **Prompt Engineering:**  
   Creating and refining detailed prompts for each page:
   - Homepage

   - Testimonials & Success Stories
3. **Component Enhancement:**  
   Adding real-time information about our college, moving away from generic or lorem-ipsum content.
4. **Iteration:**  
   Refining each page multiple times based on feedback to ensure high quality and a user-centric design.
5. **Final Assembly:**  
   Integrating all components and ensuring mobile responsiveness and SEO best practices.
